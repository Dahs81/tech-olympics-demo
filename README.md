# TCP Client/Server

This is a very simple echo server used for my Tech Olympics workshop.

How to use:

1. In one terminal, `cd server` and run `go run main.go`
1. In another terminal `cd client` and run `go run main.go`
1. Type any text in the client terminal and watch it echo on the server.
1. Type "Done" in the client terminal to close it out.
